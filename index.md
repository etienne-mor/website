# Politics in sports media through quotes

## Are certain media more prone to publish political quotes in their sports article ?

So far it appears that quotes among sports media are actually linked to politics. However, we still wonder if all medias are the same regarding this bias. To do so, we can have a look to the proportion of political speakers among the different sports media. However, we have more than 2 000 different media sources, so we first need to pick a selection of them. Let's have look to the 30 biggest sports media in terms of number of sport quotes between 2015 and 2020 :

We can see that the 30 biggest medias have at least 300 000 quotes whereas only two medias really stand out : Yahoo and MSN with more than 2 million sport quotes.
Now, that we have this selection of sports media, let's see what the proportion of political speakers in sport quotes there is for each media :

As one can observe on this image, the proportion of political speakers among the different media ranges from 1.5% for Skysports to 71% for krmg. This seems to indicate that certain media are definitely more politicized than others and uses their sports section also for political reasons.

## Evolution of the phenomenon through time

Another interesting question to ask is : how does the phenonenon of having politicized quotes in sports article evolves through time. For instance, does it increases during the during the campaigns of the US presedential elections ? 

To try to bring an answer, we wanted to have a look at the policized sports quotes each month over the years and here is what we obtained :

Unfortunately, as one can observe, it is not possible to identify any trends due to the huge variations of sports quotes through the years, itself related to the variation of all the quotes availble in the database at first. Indeed, we relate the drops in 2016 to the one mentionned in the [article about quotebank](https://dlab.epfl.ch/people/west/pub/Vaucher-Spitz-Catasta-West_WSDM-21.pdf).

However, another approach is to have a look at the media themselves and how their tendancies have evolved through time :

This first graph shows the standard deviation of the percentage of politicised sports quotes over the 6 years of data. We can observe that certain media are very stable with a standard deviation inferior to 1% over 6 years, whereas other are highly unstable, reaching more than 26% for KRMG. This could be related to a change of internal policy or direction. 

To visualize better what is going on through the years for the most unstable medias, i.e. with a standard deviation superior to 10 :

We can observe that for instance that for MSN there is a downward trend with a sharp drop after 2015, but it stayed relatively stable afterwards. JDSupra shows no clear trends whereas the rest of the medias show relatively upward trends.
